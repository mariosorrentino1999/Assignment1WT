### DESCRIPTION OF MY CONTRIBUTION:
The project was carried out by Mario Sorrentino and focuses on developing a quiz game characterized by dynamic content defined by multiple independent JSON structures.
For the user interface and user experience, I've paid special attention by using specialized CSS frameworks to ensure the highest possible quality.
While coding the application, I have adopted the best practices of "clean code" to ensure code readability and efficient maintenance.
Even though there are only 10 questions, it's possible to achieve a higher score because multiple-choice questions assign a variable score from 0 to 4 based on correct answers. This approach was chosen to reward accurate answers and encourage precise participation.
An additional enhancement I could implement is integrating specific feedback to be displayed in the quiz summary at the end.
